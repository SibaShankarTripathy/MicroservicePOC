#spring.application.name=ms-proj3-producer-service
spring.application.name=Producer-Service

server.port=8763

# Force Eureka to use IP instead of hostname
eureka.instance.prefer-ip-address=true
#This above line is most important because if your hostname like abc_def then it will not accept _ value as a result you will get error.
# So batter to IP address It will not impact anything

#-----------------------------------------------------
# This is extra thing that to create multiple instance of same service with different port number
# Instance Id
eureka.instance.instance-id=${spring.application.name}:${random.value}
# To run multiple instance of same service just change the port number here save and run again. Then refresh consumer service url.
# When you will refresh/hit multiple time to consumer url then randomly it will hit already running producer instance.
# To run multiple instance do not keep Spring Devtool Dependency.
#-----------------------------------------------------


# This is Producer Service example of using FeignClient.
# To create this service basic dependency we need Spring Web and Eureka Discovery Client.
# Eureka Discovery Client is ussed to communicate individual service like this Producer Service with Eureka Service.
# This Eureka Discovery Client also provide @EnableDiscoveryClient Annotation.
# Make sure @EnableDiscoveryClient must present on above main() of this service. Then only it will behave as microservice.
